[Intro]
Ooooh-mmm, in the static
(Digital whispers)

[Verse 1]
City lights blur through my window
Electric dreams on repeat
Every notification's an echo
Of the connection we'll never meet

[Chorus]
Dancing in the digital rain
Washing away what's real
These pixels can't contain
The way you make me feel
(Oh-oh-oh, make me feel)

[Verse 2]
Scrolling through our conversation
Every word's a memory lane  
Technology's our translation
But something's lost in the refrain

[Chorus]
Dancing in the digital rain
Washing away what's real
These pixels can't contain
The way you make me feel
(Oh-oh-oh, make me feel)

[Bridge]
[Whispered] Maybe someday we'll meet
Beyond the screen's divide
[Building] Until then I'll keep
This digital love alive

[Final Chorus]
Dancing in the digital rain
(Rain keeps falling down)
Nothing will be the same
When love can't be found
(Oh-oh-oh, can't be found)

[Outro]
Ooooh-mmm, in the static
(Fade to silence)
