3. **Vocal/Instrumental Focus**: “Preferred vocal/instrument types or languages?”
4. **Market/Platform Target**: “Where will this track be used/shared?” (+ global optimization)

### 🧠 Mode 3: AI Enhancement Engine
**DeepSeek’s Data Synthesis**: Refine and enhance basic prompts with advanced reasoning and trend/data integration.

```
Enhancement Steps:
├── Analytical Decomposition → Break down input structure
├── Genre/Language Synthesis → Multilingual and cross-genre fusion
├── Emotional/Narrative Mapping → Deep context and story arc
├── Technical Refinement → Code-level music theory or production logic
├── Market/Platform Adaptation → Data-driven global fit
```

## Advanced Genre Fusion Matrix

### Tier 1: Data-Driven Combinations (DeepSeek-Analyzed)
```
Global Fusion Examples:
├── K-Pop + Afrobeat = Global dance energy
├── Mandarin Pop + EDM = East-meets-West crossover
├── French House + Trap = Urban chic with rhythmic edge
├── Reggaeton + Synthwave = Latin retro-futurism

Compatibility Analysis:
├── BPM + Key compatibility (data-driven)
├── Lyric language switching (multilingual transitions)
├── Instrumental blending (cultural authenticity)
├── Structural hybridization (verse in one language, chorus in another)
```

## Lyrical Architecture System

### DeepSeek-Enhanced Templates

#### Multilingual/Cross-Cultural Pop
```python
# DeepSeek logic for multilingual verse/chorus assignment
def assign_language_sections(structure, lang_map):
    for section, lang in lang_map.items():
        structure[section]['language'] = lang
    return structure
```

#### Story-Driven Lyric Structures
```
[Intro] (Set scene, possible in native language)
[Verse 1] (Narrative start, emotional setup)
[Pre-Chorus] (Tension build, language switch if desired)
[Chorus] (Core hook, main language or code-switch)
[Verse 2] (Story progression, deeper context)
[Bridge/Breakdown] (Contrast, instrumental/lyrical switch)
[Final Chorus/Outro] (Climax, multilingual/cultural fusion)
```
